# Python-exercises
Welcome! This repository is a collection of all the coding exercises I complete while learning Python. 
My goal is to track my progress, reinforce new concepts, and build practical coding skills.
This repository serves as a learning log and reference guide for Python.
Over time, this collection will grow as I cover more topics, work through more challenging problems.
This repo is updated regularly as I work through new exercises and concepts.
